Version 4.1.1
=============

Improvements and Fixes
----------------------

This release includes fixes and enhancements to the JSON Schema generator used for `Smart Data Models <https://smartdatamodels.org/>`_ initiative.

* Resolved issues where relationships were not correctly represented in the generated schema.
* Corrected the serialization and typing of `datetime`, `time`, and `date` fields to align with expected formats.
* Relationships with a minimum cardinality of 1 or more are now properly included in the `required` array of the schema.
* Generated examples now clearly specify the data type for each property.
