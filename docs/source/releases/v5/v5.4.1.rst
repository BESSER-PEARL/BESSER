=============

Fixe
-----

* Fixed issue: `#368 <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER/issues/368>`_  
  Resolved a bug where the OCL parser incorrectly handled constraints due to mismatches between the editor and backend parsing logic. OCL constraints are now parsed consistently and correctly across both components.
