Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BESSER! This section covers
everything you need to get started, from setting up your environment to
submitting a pull request.

.. tip::
   Not sure where to start? Check :doc:`areas` to find the part of the codebase
   that matches your interests, or browse
   `open issues <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER/issues>`_ labeled
   ``good first issue``.

Code Style
----------

- **Python**: PEP 8, 4-space indentation, 120-character line limit
- **Linting**: The CI pipeline uses `Ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_ with
  rules E, W, F enabled. Run locally before pushing:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install ruff
     ruff check besser/

- **Naming**: ``snake_case`` for functions and variables, ``PascalCase`` for classes,
  ``UPPER_CASE`` for constants
- **Commits**: Use `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/>`_
  (``feat:``, ``fix:``, ``refactor:``, ``docs:``, ``test:``)

Branching and PR Workflow
-------------------------

1. Create a feature branch from ``development`` (e.g., ``feature/add-rdf-generator``).
2. Make focused, incremental commits.
3. Run tests: ``python -m pytest tests/``
4. Run linting: ``ruff check besser/``
5. Build docs (if changed): ``cd docs && make html``
6. Push and open a pull request against ``development`` (not ``master`` —
   see :doc:`../contributor_guide`).
7. Fill in the PR description with: what changed, why, how to test, any follow-up work.
8. Respond to review feedback — reviews are collaborative.

CI will automatically run tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12, Ruff linting, and a
docs build gated on new Sphinx warnings.
