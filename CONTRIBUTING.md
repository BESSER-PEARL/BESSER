# Contributing to this repository

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to our project!

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved and how your contribution will be considered.

## Asking Questions 

Do you have a question? Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER/issues/new/choose).

Project maintainers will be eager to listen from you and help you out. Please, try to compose a clear and concise question. The more information you provide, the better we will be able to help you.

## Reporting Issues

Do you have you identified a reproducible problem in our code? or have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Please follow the next steps:

### Look For an Existing Issue

Sometimes the issue you want to report is being already addressed, or is planned to be addressed soon. Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, do not hesitate to make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Please, use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment, we believe it's easy: üëç for upvoting and üëé for downvoting.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, [create a new issue](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER/issues/new/choose). The template will guide you on the issue reporting.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Whenever possible, we ask you to file a single issue per problem and feature request. Please do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue, as it may be hard to track the progress.

As you can imagine, the more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

### Creating Pull Requests

If you feel brave enough to contribute directly code to the repository, you are more than welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests to this repository, which we will review according to the governance rules of the project.

### Governance

Any contribution you send to us will be addressed by the project maintainers following the governance rules described in the [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)
