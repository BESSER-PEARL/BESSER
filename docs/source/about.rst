About
=====

BESSER is an `FNR-funded PEARL project <https://www.fnr.lu/funding-instruments/pearl/>`_ that stands for BEtter Smart Software fastER (BESSER) - *An 
Intelligent low-code infrastructure for smart software*. BESSER is hosted via a joint structural collaboration lead by `LIST <https://www.list.lu/>`_ 
and with the participation of `SnT/UL <https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt>`_, it has the aim to combine both strategic research and applied research. The results 
of BESSER will have a strong scientific, technical and economic impact by expanding the number of potential smart software creators, 
**increasing the quality and reducing the time-to-market** for this type of software. This project can **democratize the creation of smart software**, 
a key benefit in the current developers shortage. Moreover, by simplifying the specification and testing of ethical concerns, BESSER can also play a role
in the fair use of AI in software, a major societal challenge. Overall, I strongly believe BESSER will significantly improve the **competitiveness** of 
Luxembourgian and, in general, European companies in the global market.
