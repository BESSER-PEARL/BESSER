Version 6.2.0
==============

This release refreshes the web app generator frontend stack, fixes React
generation issues, and improves deployment defaults.

New Features
-------------

**Frontend generator architecture refresh**

- The web app generator now creates a page component per screen instead of
  relying on a runtime renderer, making the frontend easier to read, customize,
  and maintain.

**Vite migration for generated frontends**

- The React template now uses Vite for development and production builds.
- Generated apps build to the ``build`` folder for compatibility with existing
  deployment workflows.


Fixes
------

- **Web app generator**: Navigation parsing now preserves mixed content (logo, links, footer) instead
  of collapsing into a stripped menu.
- Validation toasts now stay within the viewport instead of overflowing to the right.
- Fixes #390: Render deploy frontend no longer bakes an incorrect backend URL when service names are auto-suffixed.
- Fixes #389: Replace the runtime renderer with per-page generation to make the webapp output maintainable.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Frontend environment variables now use ``VITE_API_URL`` and
  ``VITE_AGENT_URL``. Update any existing deployment or local ``.env`` files.
