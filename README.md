BESSER is a [low-modeling](https://modeling-languages.com/welcome-to-the-low-modeling-revolution/) [low-code](https://lowcode-book.com/) open-source platform. BESSER (Building bEtter Smart Software fastER) is funded thanks to an [FNR Pearl grant](https://modeling-languages.com/a-smart-low-code-platform-for-smart-software-in-luxembourg-goodbye-barcelona/) led by the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu/) with the participation of the [Snt/University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) and open to all your contributions!

The BESSER low-code platform is built on top of [B-UML](https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buml_language.html) our Python-based personal interpretation of a "Universal Modeling Language" (yes, heavily inspired and a simplified version of the better known UML, the Unified Modeling Language). 
With B-UML you can specify your software application and then use any of the [code-generators available](https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generators.html) to translate your model into executable code suitable for various applications, such as Django models or database structures compatible with SQLAlchemy.

**Check out the official [documentation](https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

## Basic Installation

BESSER works with Python 3.10+. We recommend creating a virtual environment (e.g. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)).

The latest stable version of BESSER is available in the Python Package Index (PyPi) and can be installed using

    $ pip install besser

BESSER can be used with any of the popular IDEs for Python development such as [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), etc.

## Running BESSER Locally

If you are interested in developing new code generators or designing BESSER extensions, you can download and modify the full codebase, including tests and examples.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER.git
    $ cd BESSER

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment

Run the setup script to create a virtual environment (if not already created), install the requirements, and configure the ``PYTHONPATH``. This ensures compatibility with IDEs (like VSCode) that may not automatically set the ``PYTHONPATH`` for recognizing *besser* as an importable module.

    $ python setup_environment.py

**Note:** Each time you start your IDE, run the `setup_environment.py` script to ensure the environment is properly configured.

### Step 3: Run an example

To verify the setup, you can run a basic example.

    $ cd tests/structural/library
    $ python library.py
