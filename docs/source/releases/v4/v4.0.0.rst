-----------------------------

**Web Modeling Editor**:

* Introduced project management support, allowing users to create projects and organize all related models (e.g., class diagrams, object models, etc.) within a single project workspace.

* Added support for OCL constraints in Object Diagrams, allowing validation of object instances based on constraints defined in the associated Class Diagram.

**BESSER Low-code Platform**:

* Introduced a fluent API for defining object models.
* Added the concept of Projects to group related models.
* Added backend support for validating object models against OCL constraints using the `B-OCL interpreter <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/B-OCL-Interpreter>`_.

**Documentation**:
