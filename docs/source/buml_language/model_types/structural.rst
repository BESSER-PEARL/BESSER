Structural model
================

The structural metamodel enables the specification of a domain model using the typical concepts of a class diagram. 
Elements such as *Classes*, *Properties*, *Associations*, and *Generalizations* can be instantiated to define the static 
structure of a system or application. While this metamodel is rooted in the UML specification, certain modifications and 
additions have been implemented to provide additional modeling capabilities. For instance, the *is_id* attribue 
has been introduced in the *Property* class to specify whether a property serves as an identifier for the instances of that
class, a common need in many code generation scenarios.
