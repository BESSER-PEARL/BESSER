Version 2.3.0
=============

New Features
------------

* Feature metamodel extension: In B-UML you can define now feature models to define structured representations of the features (functionalities or characteristics) of a system, capturing their variability and dependencies.
* JSON Schema generator: This generator consumes a B-UML structural model and produces the equivalent JSON schema that can be used to validate whether given JSON objects conform to the schema.

Improvements
------------

* The `is_derived` boolean attribute was included for classes in the structural metamodel
* New constraint included in structural models to avoid spaces in the names of objects
* SQL Alchemy generator: Added a new attribute for the database management system (DBMS) to be used. Defaults to `sqlite`
