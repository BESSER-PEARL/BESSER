New Features and Improvements
-----------------------------

**Web Modeling Editor**:

* Added support for Agent model creation and visualization
* Agent code generation: Generate fully functional conversational agents directly from agent models using `BESSER Agentic Framework (BAF) <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER-Agentic-Framework>`_
* Enhanced structural models with metadata support - you can now add descriptions and URIs to classes


**BESSER Low-code Platform**:

* Agent metamodel extension: In B-UML you can now define agent models to represent intelligent entities with state machine-like behavior, including states, transitions, events, conditions, actions, and sessions for building conversational and autonomous agents.
* Agent code generation: Generate fully functional conversational agents directly from agent models using BAF, with complete Python code including intents, entities, states, transitions, and platform integrations ready for deployment.
* Structural metamodel enhancement: Added MetadataClass support allowing you to enrich your models with descriptions, URIs, and synonyms for better documentation and semantic information.
* Improved the Python Generator to support generation of methods to handle bidirectional consistency in associations
