Version 6.1.0
==============

This release introduces the ability to **link state machines or quantum circuits to methods** in the Web Modeling Editor, **GitHub project versioning** (experimental), and **Knowledge Graph import to Class Diagram**.

New Features
-------------

**Method Implementation Types**

- Methods can now reference state machines or quantum circuits as their implementation.
- Added ``MethodImplementationType`` enum to support different method behaviors: ``none``, ``code``, ``state_machine``, and ``quantum_circuit``.
- Updated code generation to include method implementation type and behavioral references in generated code.

**Knowledge Graph Import**

- Added **Import Class Diagram from Knowledge Graph (KG)** feature to the Web Modeling Editor.
- Supports importing TTL, RDF, and JSON-LD files and converting them to UML Class Diagrams using OpenAI's GPT.

**GitHub Project Versioning (Experimental)**

- Introduced experimental support for **GitHub-based project save and versioning**.
- Enables users to save projects directly to GitHub repositories with version control.
- Provides foundation for collaborative modeling workflows.
