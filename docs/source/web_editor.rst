Web Modeling Editor
===================

One of the practical ways to use BESSER is through the Web Modeling Editor, where you can rapidly 
design :doc:`B-UML <../buml_language>` models and try the :doc:`BESSER code generators <../generators>`.

.. note::
   The BESSER Web Editor is now live and available at `editor.besser-pearl.org <https://editor.besser-pearl.org>`_. You can access and use it directly in your browser without installing anything locally.
