Web Modeling Editor
===================

One of the practical ways to use BESSER is through the Web Modeling Editor, where you can rapidly 
design :doc:`B-UML <../buml_language>` models and use the :doc:`BESSER code generators <../generators>`.

.. note::
   The BESSER Web Editor is now live and available at `editor.besser-pearl.org <https://editor.besser-pearl.org>`_. 
   You can access and use it directly in your browser without installing anything locally.

The full Web Modeling Editor documentation is published as a separate subproject:
`BESSER Web Modeling Editor documentation <https://besser.readthedocs.io/projects/besser-web-modeling-editor/en/latest/>`_.

The editor's source code is available in the
`BESSER_WME GitHub repository <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER_WME_standalone>`_.

.. note::
   The BESSER Web Editor is based on a fork of the 
   `Apollon project <https://apollon-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, a UML modeling editor.
