Version 2.5.1
=============

Improvements
--------------
- Includes automatic installation of the following packages when using ``pip install besser[nn]``:

  - pillow>=11.1.0
  - numpy>=2.2.4
  - torch>=2.6.0
- Added support for neural network packages with local installation via ``--nn`` flag in setup_environment.py

.. note::

    The neural network dependencies have been made optional to reduce the installation footprint for users
    who don't need these capabilities.
