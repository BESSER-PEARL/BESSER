Mobile Application example
==========================

To develop mobile applications with BESSER, you can use our :doc:`Flutter Code Generator <../generators/flutter>`. In the following example
we will create a mobile application for the :doc:`Library example<../examples/library_example>` domain. This example consists of detailed
instructions and code snippets, guiding you through the seamless integration of the generated code into your Flutter application.

The Flutter Code Generator requires two different B-UML models as input: the :doc:`structural<../buml_language/model_types/structural>` 
and the :doc:`GUI<../buml_language/model_types/gui>` models.

Input models definition
-----------------------

* Structural model: For the structural model, we will reuse the model defined in our :doc:`Library example<../examples/library_example>`.
* GUI model: the GUI model to define the GUI elements such as lists, buttons, screens, and view components that will interact with our library structural model.
  The following code demonstrates how we connect these models:

.. code-block:: python

  from besser.BUML.metamodel.gui import *

  # The GUI will use the Library structural model classes
  # to create views and handle data operations
  from library import * 
   
  # The GUI will use the Library structural model classes
  # to create views and handle data operations
  from library import *

Code Generation
---------------

To use the Flutter code generator, simply provide the input models and use the ``generate()`` method, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from besser.generators.flutter import FlutterGenerator
  from library import library_model # Structural model
  from gui import MyApp, MyHomeScreen # GUI model
  
  code_gen = FlutterGenerator(model=library_model, application=MyApp, main_page=MyHomeScreen)
  code_gen.generate()

The ``output/`` folder with the ``main.dart``, ``sql_helper.dart``, and ``pubspec.yaml`` files will be produced.

Application running
-------------------

After generating these files, you will need to incorporate them into your Flutter application. 
Please ensure that you create an app with the same name as specified for the ``Application`` object in the GUI model
(``Library Management`` for this example). To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Flutter application with the desired app name.
2. Locate the ``sql_helper.dart`` file generated by the Flutter Code Generator.
3. Copy the ``sql_helper.dart`` file into the lib folder of your Flutter application.
4. Locate the existing ``main.dart`` file in the lib folder of your Flutter application.
5. Replace the existing ``main.dart`` file with the generated main.dart file from the Flutter Code Generator.
6. Locate the existing ``pubspec.yaml`` file in the root directory of your Flutter application.
7. Replace the existing ``pubspec.yaml`` file with the generated pubspec.yaml file.

After completing these steps, your Flutter application should have the following structure:

.. image:: ../img/app_structure.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: Flutter app structure
  :align: center

Upon running your Flutter code, the main page of your application should resemble the following figure:

.. image:: ../img/main_page.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: main page of app
  :align: center


According to the main page specifications, three buttons are present: "Library List," "Author List," and "Book List."
For example, on the "Library Directory" page, you can enter multiple libraries along with their associated information based on the attributes specified in the structural model.
The figure below demonstrates the required steps to enter a library with all its information:

.. image:: ../img/library_list.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: add a new library
  :align: center

After entering three libraries, the "Library Directory" page would appear as shown below:

.. image:: ../img/library_directory.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: add three libraries
  :align: center

Each library entry is accompanied by two icons: a pen icon for performing update operations and a delete icon for deletion operations.

Similarly, on the "Author Directory" page, you can enter multiple authors along with their respective information. 
The figure below showcases the content of this page after entering three authors:


.. image:: ../img/author_directory.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: add three authors
  :align: center

On the "Book Directory" page, you can enter multiple books along with their corresponding information. 
The figure below illustrates the steps required to enter a book with the following details: title = "The Great Gatsby", pages = "180", library = "New York Public Library", and author = "F. Scott Fitzgerald".

.. image:: ../img/book_list.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: add a new book
  :align: center

Upon entering three books, the "Book Directory" page would appear as follows:

.. image:: ../img/book_directory.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: add a new book
  :align: center

Additionally, you can view the entered elements in the database for the following tables:

"Library" table: 

.. image:: ../img/library_table.png
  :width: 450
  :alt: library table
  :align: center


"Author" table: 

.. image:: ../img/author_table.png
  :width: 450
  :alt: author table
  :align: center


"Book" table: 

.. image:: ../img/book_table.png
  :width: 450
  :alt: book table
  :align: center

"book_author_assoc" table: 

.. image:: ../img/book_author_assoc_table.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: book_author_assoc table
  :align: center
