Version 6.0.0
==============

This release introduces **GitHub OAuth integration and automatic deployment on Render**,  
along with improved environment configuration, frontend flexibility across environments, and important backend code-generation fixes.

New Features
=============

GitHub OAuth Integration & Render Auto-Deployment
--------------------------------------------------

- Added **GitHub OAuth integration for WME**, enabling secure authentication and repository authorization.
- Implemented a **deployment API that automatically provisions and deploys applications on Render** after successful OAuth authentication.
- Deployment flow eliminates manual setup by linking GitHub repositories directly to Render services.

Improvements
============

- Added a comprehensive `.env.example` file documenting all required environment variables.
- Replaced hardcoded backend URLs in generated React components with `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`, enabling flexible frontend deployment across environments.

Bug Fixes
=========

- #378 

Backend Code Generation
------------------------

- Refactored object creation logic to use **Jinja2 namespaces** for collecting constructor arguments, fixing issues with missing or duplicated parameters.
- Improved generated REST endpoints for **many-to-many (N:M) relationships**, including self-referential associations, to avoid naming conflicts and ensure correct query generation.
