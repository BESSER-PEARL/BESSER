## General Guidelines
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Follow the existing code style and conventions in each submodule.
- Use descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- Add or update docstrings for all public classes and methods.
- Prefer type annotations for all function signatures (Python, TypeScript, etc.).
- Avoid code duplication; refactor or reuse existing utilities where possible.
- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all code passes linting and formatting checks before committing.
