Version 5.2.0
=============

This release delivers major enhancements to the agent modeling framework, a full overhaul of the validation pipeline, improvements to pydantic code generation, and several fixes that strengthen correctness and consistency across the toolchain.

New Features and Improvements
-----------------------------

**No-Code Editor & WebApp Generator**

* Added the ability to **link agents directly from the no-code editor**, enabling users to reference agents visually during modeling.
* Extended the **WebApp generator** to automatically generate these agent links inside the generated application.

**Agent Framework**

* Introduced a flexible **Action abstraction** for agent state machines, including `CustomCodeAction`, `AgentReply`, and `LLMReply`.
* Refactored state **Body** to store structured action sequences and generate cleaner, more maintainable code.
* Added **AgentComponent** to the GUI metamodel for visual agent representation.
* Extended the **React dashboard generator** to render agent components in the generated frontend.
* Enhanced agent code-generation templates with improved platform/LLM initialization and support for **speech input/output** modalities.

**Pydantic Models**

* Improved class generation by **sorting models by inheritance**, ensuring parent classes are created before children.
* Removed duplicated inherited attributes and improved overall naming and import consistency.

**Validation System**

* Added the centralized ``validate()`` method to **DomainModel** and updated backend endpoints to use structured validation instead of exception catching.
* Removed redundant validation calls — the backend is now the **single source of truth** for validation.
* Standardized validation output with **unified, structured error reporting** across all diagram types.
* Enabled automatic validation through property setters for consistent and early error detection.

**Code Quality**

* Centralized validation logic in the metamodel.
* Standardized the validation pipeline: **Build BUML → Validate → Run OCL → Return structured results**.
* Improved naming rules and import hygiene across the platform.
