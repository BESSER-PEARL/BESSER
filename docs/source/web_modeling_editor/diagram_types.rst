Diagram Types
=============

The BESSER Web Modeling Editor supports multiple types of diagrams, each designed for specific modeling purposes. This section provides comprehensive documentation for all supported diagram types.

Overview
--------

The Web Modeling Editor allows you to create various types of UML and domain-specific diagrams:

* **Class Diagrams**: Model the static structure of your system
* **Object Diagrams**: Show instances and snapshots of your system
* **State Machine Diagrams**: Model dynamic behavior and state transitions
* **Agent Diagrams**: Design conversational agents and their behaviors

Each diagram type has its own specific elements and notation. You can combine multiple diagram types
in a single project to create comprehensive models of your system.
