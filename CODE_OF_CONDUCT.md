## Long Version

As contributors and maintainers in this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including contributors, maintainers, administrators, and any kind of participant in the project. 

Project maintainers will enforce this code at all times. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

The Code of Conduct, and the project leaders, can only address behavior in the present, not past behavior or fears of what someone might do based on past behavior.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at:

* [Iván Alfonso](https://github.com/ivan-alfonso) 
* [Armen Sulejmani](https://github.com/ArmenSl)
* [Jordi Cabot](https://github.com/jcabot)

Complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
