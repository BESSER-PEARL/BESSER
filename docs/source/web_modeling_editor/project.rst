Each project can contain four types of models: class diagram, object model, state
machine diagram, and agent model (more model types will be added in the future).

To import an existing project, click the **Import Project** button. You can either
select a file or drag and drop it into the designated area. The WME supports importing
projects in B-UML format (`.py` files), which is the standard format for BESSER projects,
as well as in JSON format (supported by the WME).
