Version 4.0.0

New Features and Improvements
-----------------------------

**Web Modeling Editor**:

* Introduced project management support, allowing users to create projects and organize all related models (e.g., class diagrams, object models, etc.) within a single project workspace.
* Added support for creating and editing Object Diagrams, allowing you to represent instances of classes and their relationships defined in the Class Diagram (or structural model).
* Added support for OCL constraints in Object Diagrams, allowing validation of object instances based on constraints defined in the associated Class Diagram.

**BESSER Low-code Platform**:

* Introduced a fluent API for defining object models.
* Added the concept of Projects to group related models.
* Added backend support for validating object models against OCL constraints using the `B-OCL interpreter <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/B-OCL-Interpreter>`_.

**Documentation**:

* Updated the Web Modeling Editor documentation, including new sections for :doc:`Project Management <../../web_modeling_editor/project>` and :doc:`Diagram Types <../../web_modeling_editor/diagram_types>`.
