Contributing
======================

We highly value and welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve the platform. Before opening
an issue or pull request, read our `CONTRIBUTING policy <https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
so you understand the review workflow, coding standards, and communication channels.

Use the guides in this section to discover the architecture, pick the area that matches your interests, and follow
repeatable steps when extending BESSER (from the B-UML language to the code generators and the web modeling editor).
